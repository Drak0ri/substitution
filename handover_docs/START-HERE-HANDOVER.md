# 🚀 IMMEDIATE HANDOVER - Teacher Finder Exclusion Feature

## What You Need to Tell Claude Code:

```
Hi Claude Code,

I need you to implement a staff exclusion feature in our Teacher Finder app.

All the code is ready - you just need to integrate it into index.html.

📁 START HERE: Read `/mnt/user-data/outputs/HANDOVER-TO-CLAUDE-CODE.md`

This file has:
✅ Complete step-by-step instructions (5 steps)
✅ Exact line numbers and locations
✅ All code snippets ready to copy
✅ Testing checklist
✅ Debugging guide

📦 SUPPORTING FILES (all in /mnt/user-data/outputs/):
- exclusion-feature-code.js (JavaScript to add)
- exclusion-feature-styles.css (CSS to add)
- exclusion-feature-html.txt (HTML to modify)
- QUICK-REFERENCE.md (quick lookup)
- EXCLUSION-FEATURE-CHANGELOG.md (for Gareth)

🎯 WHAT THE FEATURE DOES:
Users can click a red × button to temporarily exclude teachers from availability lists.
Excluded teachers can be viewed/restored via a "Show Excluded" toggle.
Everything persists across page reloads.

⏱️ TIME: 15-20 minutes
🔧 COMPLEXITY: Low (well-documented, non-breaking)
📝 FILES: Only index.html needs modification

Please implement following the HANDOVER document and report back with test results.
